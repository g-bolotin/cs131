[Task 1]
	Sort the pickup location IDs in order to find the most popular pickup locations on January 2nd, 2019.
	Identify the top 3 locations.

	Steps:

	1. Filter out anything not from Jan 2nd, 2019.
	2. Sort by pickup location ID (pulocationid).
	3. Count how many references to unique location IDs there are.


	Commands:

	1. cut -d, -f2- 2019-01-h1.csv > no_vendorid.csv

		cut 					Command for removing data by pattern.
		
		-d,					Delimiter option (comma for comma-separated data).
		
		-f2-					Select fields starting from column 2 (pickup date/time).
							We don't care about column 1, makes it easier to pattern match. 
		
		2019-01-h1.csv > no_vendorid.csv	Input file is the original dataset, write results to new file.


	2. grep '^"2019-01-02 ' no_vendorid.csv | sort -t, -k7,7g > sorted_jan2.csv

		grep					Command for pattern matching.

		'^"2019-01-02 '				Pattern for lines starting with '"2019-01-02 '.

		sort					Command for sorting lines of data.

		-t,					Field separator option (comma).

		-k7,7g					Column 7 of no_vendorid.csv (pickup location ID) is the key to sort							   by, sorted numerically (-g).


	3. cut -d, -f7 sorted_jan2.csv | uniq -c | sort -t, -gr | head -3
		 
		-f7		For sorting, we only care about the pickup ID column (7).	
	
		uniq -c		Get the unique pickup location IDs and the number of times they appear in the dataset.
		
		sort -gr	Sort the IDs by numeric count, highest to lowest.
		
		head -3		Print only the top 3 most-referenced IDs.


	Final Result: The top 3 locations are 161.0, 132.0, and 186.0, with 8555, 8145, and 8122 pickups respectively.

		8555 161.0
		8145 132.0
		8122 186.0

[Task 2]
	Sort the pickup location IDs in order to find the most popular pickup locations on January 10th, 2019.
	
	Steps:
	Essentially do the same thing as task 1, but with a different date.

	Commands:
 
	1. grep '^"2019-01-10 ' no_vendorid.csv | sort -t, -k7,7g > sorted_jan10.csv

	2. cut -d, -f7 sorted_jan10.csv | uniq -c | sort -t, -gr | head -3
